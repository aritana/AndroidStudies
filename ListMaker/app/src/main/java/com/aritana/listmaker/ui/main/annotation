The recyclerView lets you display large amounts of data in a list
format.
Each piece of data is treated as an item within the RecyclerView.
In turn, each of these items makes up the entire contents of RV.

RecyclerViews have two required components it uses to display
a list of items, An adapter and ViewHolders.

1: RV asks the adapter how many items it has and for a viewHolder
at a given position.

2: The adapter reaches into the pool of created ViewHolders it has.

3: Either a viewHolder is returned to a data item at a given position

4: The adapter binds the ViewHolder to a data item at a given position

5. The viewHolder is returned to the RecyclerView for display


adapters give the recycler view the data it wants to show.
They have a clever way to calculate how many rows of data
you want to show.

ViewHolders are the visual containers for you item.
Think of them as placeholders for each item in the table.
This is where you tell the RV how each item should look.

As you scroll throug a RecyclerView, instead of creating new View Holders,
RecyclerView recycles ViewHOlders that move off-screen and popuates
them with new data, ready to be shown at the bottom of the list.
